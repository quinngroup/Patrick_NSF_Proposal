\required{Project Summary}
\required{Overview}
% This should be a brief description of the activity 
% that would result if the proposal were funded 
% and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.
% It should look something like an abstract. 

In this document the PIs describe an approach to identify trends in disease treatment by applying existing and novel machine learning techniques. Data sources will include both direct clinical sources and also pertinent text and metadata acquired from users of social media. High level information, analytical tools, and data resources produced through these analyses will be disseminated back into both clinical and social media venues to improve patient's direct medical outcomes and address social concerns. One specific application will focus on the use of antiretroviral therapy to preventatively treat individuals who are at-risk for HIV infection. This use of antiretroviral therapy is referd to as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and uses the small molecule nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor trade named Truvada.

\required{Intellectual Merit}
% This should describe the potential of the proposed activity
% to advance knowledge in the field of mathematics. 
The information produced through data mining and machine learning will be useful to provide clinicians and public health professionals feedback concerning successes and challenges associated with disease treatments. Pertinent tools and summary datasets will also be produced and made available to researchers. In addition novel applications of machine learning and data science methods will be developed as necessary, and shared with the data science community to assist and inspire related applications in other domain areas.

\required{Broader Impacts}
% This should describe the potential of the proposed activity
% to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of 
% specific, desired societal outcomes.
% Examples of Broader Imacts include, but are not limited to:
% 1. Full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and 
% underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, 
% and mathematics (STEM); 
% 2. Improved STEM education and educator 
% development at any level; 
% 3. Increased public scientific literacy 
% and public engagement with science and technology; 
% 4. Improved well-being of individuals in society; 
% 5. Development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce;
% 6. Increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; 
% 7. Improved national security; 
% 8. Increased economic competitiveness of the US; 
% 9. Enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

The proposed research will contribute to an increased scientific literacy through collaborations and dissemination of our findings through social media. This research will also lead to improvements of the health of all Americans, with in some cases such as PrEP, special emphasis on underrepresented groups such as the LGBT community. This work also has the potential to engage collaborations and partnerships between the social media industry, medical providers and pharmaceutical companies, and academia as we come together to improve public health.
